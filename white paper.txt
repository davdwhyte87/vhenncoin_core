Economics
the price is determined by demand and supply

there are 10trillion coins in total and more can be created if all the nodes come together
to create more

transaction fees is %1 of amount sent, and it's sent to the

Private key is generated by hashing random numbers
public key 1 is generated by hashing private key
public key is only used once.
public key is h(pk1,pk2,pk3,pk4)
private key is h(r1,r2,r3,r4)
public key 1 is h(pk1,pk2,pk3,pk4,0)
public key 2 is h(pk1,pk2,pk3,pk4,1)
public key 3 is h(pk1,pk2,pk3,pk4,2) .... etc

signature is prk1,prk2

receiver derives public key from prk1 and prk2 because he has pubk2,pubk3
he should only have those 2

full public key is used to sign message h(pubk1, pubk2,pubk3,pubk4)
but the receiver cannot sign message because he has only two public keys
once he uses private key to get public key he can sign the message to make sure
